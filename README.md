This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI, particularly in scenarios involving asynchronous operations within Expo's managed workflow. The `expoBug.js` file illustrates the problematic code, while `expoBugSolution.js` provides a solution to mitigate the issue.  The error often manifests during project setup, build processes or runtime with obscure error messages that hint towards asynchronous operation failure or incompatibility with the Expo managed workflow.
